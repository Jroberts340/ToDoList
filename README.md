# To Do List 💻📝

### This To Do List is an application I created recently for one of my college courses. The application is coded using the Java programming language and implements Java Servlets and JSP (where I got to show off my limited HTML knowledge 😉). Maven is used for build automation and it runs on a Tomcat server (localhost). I got to use Hibernate for this application so I was able to create JPA entities for mapping objects, this was useful when it came time to pass to the MySQL database associated with the To Do List. The MySQL database is where the To Do List data is selected/inserted/deleted from when an add task, delete task, or view task requested is passed. For this application, just like with HTML, I also got to show off some of my CSS skills!
